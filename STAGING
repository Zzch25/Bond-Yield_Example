		- vise versa for CF(0)

	
		EX>>

			For a 1000$ bond with 10% coupon over 5 years
			company pays 100 each year
			at the end of the 5th, 1000 is payed
			in total 1500

			user payed
			100 / (1.15^1) + ... + 100 / (1.15^5) + 1000 / (1.15^5) = <*<*< 832.4 >*>*>
			This is Yield To Maturity (YTM), executed to entice				
			The following are virtually interchangeable Yield, YTM, discount rate, discount rate, interest rate -> r
